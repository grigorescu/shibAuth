Description:
------------

This library provides a simple authentication interface to a Shibboleth
protected area, when using the Requests[1] Python HTTP library.

The ShibAuth class extends the request.auth.AuthBase class.

Example:
--------

import requests
from shibAuth.auth import shibAuth

r = requests.get("https://secret.example.com/?name=Waldo",
                 auth=shibAuth("user", "password"))

Note: To prevent having to reauthenticate with each request,
using a request.Session object is recommended.

Requirements:
-------------

 - Requests[1]
 - BeautifulSoup[2]

Configuration:
--------------

Edit shibAuth/config.py to fit your site's configuration.
